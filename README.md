# Flutter_Gallary_App
 The primary goal of this project was to put the "flutter staggered grid view" dependency and all of the grid styles it provides to users through their paces. I've included a custom bottom navigation bar from the previous POS Ticketing App that makes use of the Flutte svg and Google fonts dependencies. I intend to continue working on the project and eventually turn it into a mini-Pintrest or a small gallary app.
